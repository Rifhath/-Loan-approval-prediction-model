# A-LAP (Automatic Loan Approval Prediction)

A-LAP is an innovative solution designed to streamline the loan approval process by leveraging **machine learning**, **data analytics**, and **dynamic visualization**. Built as part of **Team Prathyegam**'s effort during Virtusa's Jatayu Season 2 competition, this project demonstrates the power of automation and customization in decision-making systems.

## Key Features

- **Accurate Predictions**: Integrates **seven machine learning models** (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boost, etc.) optimized with **dual cross-validation** to ensure high accuracy.
- **Dynamic Forms**: Generates user-specific forms based on data preprocessing to facilitate custom loan-type creation.
- **Visualization**: Enables instant dataset analysis through interactive visual tools built using JavaScript.
- **Scalability**: Handles datasets ranging from small samples to millions of records, ensuring adaptability for businesses of all scales.
- **Custom Models**: Allows users to train and test their own loan approval models with specific datasets.

## Algorithm Overview

The solution incorporates an **ensemble model** that combines:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boost Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
- Bagging Classifier
- SVC
- Extra Tree Classifier

These models are unified using a **voting classifier** to provide robust and accurate predictions.

## Unique Features

1. **Dual Cross-Validation**: Automatically fine-tunes hyperparameters to maximize performance and prevent overfitting.
2. **Custom Loan Models**: Tailored models for user-specific needs, ensuring flexibility.
3. **Advanced Data Visualization**: Includes visual interpretation tools for better dataset understanding.

---

## Roadmap

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for improved security.
- **Enhanced User Logging** to track activity.
- **Expanded Data Input Support** to handle multiple file formats beyond CSV.
- **Cluster Visualization** using unsupervised learning to identify patterns.
